# Borg repo and restic repo should be in the form sshuser@sshhost:path_to_repo,

#
# add 'backupuser@myhost.com:repos/host1' ...
# add 'backupuser@myhost.com:repos/host2' ...
#
# To avoid string interpolation problems with special characters in your repo
# passwords, use single quotes around each argument.

# time before the script will complain about not finding new backups, with the
# sixth parameter being in days:
